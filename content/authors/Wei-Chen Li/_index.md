## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in robotics as Georgia Tech. My current interest is deformable object manipulation. Utilizing simulation, control theory, and machine learning to investigate high-dimensional state-spaces. I have worked on developing algorithms for high-dimensional system identification in the past.

I have implemented a [physics engine](https://github.com/wei-chen-li/drake/tree/DER-dev/examples/multibody/filament) capable of simulating slender deformable objects with accurate contact dynamics. Some examples include [filaments](meshcat-recordings/entangling-filament-gripper.html), [ropes](meshcat-recordings/knot-tightening.html), [conveyor](meshcat-recordings/conveyor-belt.html) [belts](meshcat-recordings/crowned-pulley.html), and [shoelaces](meshcat-recordings/shoelace-tying.html).

I keep a [blog](post/) on things that are not easy to find on the internet
