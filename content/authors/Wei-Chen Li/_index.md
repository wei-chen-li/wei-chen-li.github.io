## About Me

I received my BS and MS degree from National Taiwan University. Currently I am working as a research assistant. My areas of research include modeling, Bayesian inference, and convex optimization with application to sensing and robot manipulation.

Visit my [github](https://github.com/wei-chen-li) for some of my projects.

I keep a [blog](post/) on things that are not easy to find on the internet.

I am also a film lover. Visit my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/williamrob104) profile page.
