## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in robotics as Georgia Tech. My current interest is deformable object manipulation. Utilizing simulation, control theory, and machine learning to investigate high-dimensional state-spaces. I have worked on system identification for high-dimensional systems in the past.

I have implemented a physics engine capable of simulating slender deformable object including [filaments](meshcat-recordings/entangling-filament-gripper.html), [ropes](meshcat-recordings/knot-tightening.html), [conveyor belts](meshcat-recordings/conveyor-belt.html), and [shoelaces](meshcat-recordings/shoelace-tying.html).
Visit [here](https://github.com/wei-chen-li/drake/tree/DER-dev/examples/multibody/filament) to try it out!

I keep a [blog](post/) on things that are not easy to find on the internet.

I am also a film lover. Visit my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/williamrob104) profile page.
