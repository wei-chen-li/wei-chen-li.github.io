abstract: Common imaging techniques for detecting structural defects typically require sampling at more than twice the spatial frequency to achieve a target resolution. This study introduces a novel framework for imaging structural defects using significantly fewer samples. In this framework, defects are modeled as regions where physical properties shift from their nominal values to resemble those of air, and a linear approximation is formulated to relate these binary shifts in physical properties with corresponding changes in measurements. Recovering a binary vector from linear measurements is generally an NP-hard problem. To address this challenge, this study proposes two algorithmic approaches. The first approach relaxes the binary constraint, using convex optimization to find a solution. The second approach incorporates a binary-inducing prior and employs approximate Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior probability of the binary vector given the measurements. Both algorithmic approaches demonstrate better performance compared to existing compressive sampling methods for binary vector recovery. The framework's effectiveness is illustrated through examples of eddy current sensing to image defects in metal structures.
